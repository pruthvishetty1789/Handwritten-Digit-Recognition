# 🖋️ Handwritten Digit Recognition App

This project is a **Streamlit web application** that recognizes handwritten digits drawn on an interactive canvas.  
It uses a **TensorFlow CNN model (`handwritten.h5`)** trained on the **MNIST dataset** to predict digits (0–9) and allows users to test multiple drawings while checking their overall prediction accuracy.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Draw any digit (0–9) on an interactive canvas  
✅ Predict the digit instantly using a trained deep learning model  
✅ Enter the correct digit to record prediction results  
✅ View the **accuracy of predictions** based on your drawings  
✅ Clear all results with one click
